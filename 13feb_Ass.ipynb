    "# Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans1. An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It is a way to handle errors or exceptional conditions that may arise during runtime. Exceptions provide a mechanism to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax errors occur when the code violates the syntax rules of the programming language. These errors prevent \n",
    "# the program from running and must be fixed before execution.\n",
    "# Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of a program due to various factors such as invalid \n",
    "# input, division by zero, or accessing non-existent variables. Exceptions can be handled within the program using\n",
    "# try-except blocks, allowing the program to continue running even if an exception occurs."
